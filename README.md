# HexChess
Hexagonal chess is a group of chess variants played on boards composed of hexagon cells. This is Gli≈Ñski's variant, played on a symmetric 91-cell hex board. 3 colors are typically used so that no two approximate cells are the same color, and a color-restricted game piece such as the orthodox chess bishop usually comes in sets of three per player.
